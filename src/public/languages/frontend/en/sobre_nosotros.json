In this specific case, the parties can agree on a penalty clause percentage between 20% and 40% of the amount given as a deposit for the Purchase-Sale Reservation. If the buyer does not comply, the seller is protected by the penalty clause to the extent that they can retain the agreed percentage, and from that retained amount, only 1% of the real estate company's commission needs to be paid for administrative expenses."
