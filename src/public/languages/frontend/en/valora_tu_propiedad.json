    "questions": {
      "question_one": {
        "title": "How do I determine the value of my property?",
        "answer": "Basically, there are two ways to determine the value of your property: On one hand, you can get an online valuation of your home to get an initial assessment. Additionally, if you want something more personalized, we offer the possibility of requesting a property appraisal with our real estate consultants who are experts in your area. Just contact us to schedule a visit. Both services are, of course, free of charge and without obligation."
      },
      "question_two": {
        "title": "What factors influence the value of my home?",
        "answer": "Many factors influence the market price of a home. These include: • The location of the property • The living area and the size of the plot • The date of construction and the structural condition • The amenities of the property (e.g., number of rooms, pool, cellar, or rooftop terrace) • Supply and demand in the local real estate market."
      },
      "question_three": {
        "title": "What factors are considered for the online valuation?",
        "answer": "The online valuation from Ibiza properties is based on the most important factors influencing the value of a home: • The type of property - is it, for example, a single-family or multi-family home or a condo? • The living area and the size of the property • The year of construction • The macro-location - the broader environment and region of your property • The micro-location - the district/part of the municipality where your property is located."
      },
      "question_four": {
        "title": "How accurate is the online valuation?",
        "answer": "The online home valuation is ideal for homeowners to get an estimate of the initial price of their property. All you need to do is enter some basic information, such as location and type of property. Our online valuation analyzes this data and compares it with a selection of comparable properties, complementing it with local market information. Then, the algorithm calculates the market value range of your property based on this data. The value indicated in our online valuation is therefore not an average value for properties in your location. It is always based on the individual characteristics of your property."
      },
      "question_five": {
        "title": "How can I increase the value of my property?",
        "answer": "You can take a number of steps to increase the value of your property before selling. These include: • Renovation work that will aesthetically improve the appearance of the property (e.g., wallpapering, laying carpets, renovating the exterior facades, etc.). Generally, it is easier to find a buyer if the property is well maintained. • Energy-related renovation measures (e.g., installing new windows, heating systems, etc.). The more modern and efficient a property is, the higher its value. • Create living space: convert the attic or create additional living space in the basement. Special rooms, such as a study or home theater, are not only exclusive but are highlights for potential buyers. • Install a security system: invest in intruder protection, an alarm system, light sensors, or similar security measures. • Create a barrier-free environment: widen doors or install a stairlift. This allows you to reach a wider target group and improves the valuation."
