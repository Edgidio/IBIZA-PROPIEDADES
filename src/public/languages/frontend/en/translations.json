      "faq_4": {
        "question": "If I am a property owner and contract a real estate service, what happens if the buyer retracts during the purchase-sale operation and does not pay the agreed price?",
        "answer": "IBIZA PROPERTIES has a legal advisor specializing in tenancy law within its staff of real estate advisors. Their main goal is to legally shield the client from everything they have to sign in a purchase-sale operation. In this specific case, the parties can agree on a penalty clause percentage, which can be between 20% and 40% of the amount given in advance to celebrate the Purchase Sale Reservation. If the buyer does not comply, the seller is protected by the penalty clause percentage to the point where they can retain the agreed percentage, and from that retained amount, they only have to pay the 1% company commission for administrative expenses."
